## Point.oh

This project is a library to control input formatting using JavaScript. It was
started because some of the available tools at the moment had certain shortcomings
and configuration quirks that made them unsuitable for a specific use case at the
time.

The project is unmaintained and not finished, and it still has noticeable bugs. It
was left in this state becasuse we eventualy found better tooling that fixed our
issues without the need to reinvent the wheel.

A playgroung is currently hosted at <https://pointoh.carlos.marchal.page>.
